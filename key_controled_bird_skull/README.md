# Animatronic Bird Head Controller 

## Usage
- For running as part of a fortune teller, run `bird_skull_main.py`
  - Once sound is added I _think_ this will need to be run as root. 
- Running via the keyboard run `bird_skull_keyboard_control.py`
- All servo movements and fortune sound files are specified in `fortunes.json`
